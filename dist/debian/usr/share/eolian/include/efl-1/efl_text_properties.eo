              This function allows the font name and size of a text object to
              be set. The font string has to follow fontconfig's convention on
              naming fonts, as it's the underlying library used to query system
              fonts by Evas (see the fc-list command's output, on your system,
              to get an idea). Alternatively, one can use a full path to a font
              file.

              Evas and should not have free() called on it by the caller of the
              function.
